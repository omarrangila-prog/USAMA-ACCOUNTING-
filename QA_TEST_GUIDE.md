# Bond Ledger OS — QA Test Guide (Q & A)

A complete manual test plan. Each test has **Steps → Expected Result**.
Mark each **Pass / Fail**. Run top-to-bottom; later tests assume earlier data exists.

- **Env:** `npm run dev` → open the printed URL.
- **Data mode:** Real Firebase (`osama-accounting`) if `.env` has keys and `VITE_USE_MOCK=false`; otherwise local demo mode.
- **Reset for a clean run:** Demo mode → clear browser storage (DevTools → Application → Local Storage → clear). Firebase mode → delete docs under `users/bond-workspace/…` in the console.
